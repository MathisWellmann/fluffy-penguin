# fluffy-penguin
Implementation of the ENT2 genetic algorithm in Rust, because both are awesome =]

## TODO
* [ ] Implement CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy) and its multi-objective optimization (MO-CMA-ES).
* [ ] Add advanced scoring methods (looking into python's scikit-learn library might be a good start).
* [ ] Implement the EANT2 pruning method of unnecessary connections during neuro-evolution.
* [ ] Improve API documentation.
* [ ] Limit the number of concurrent renderer process and put it in a non blocking thread.
